1. Basic Design
    a.Figma!

3. way to interact with bpm while playing


thoughts:
check browsers for maximum number of oscillators
don't automatically play overtone sets

I should make the initial selection of pitch range be one button that then prompts for lower boundary and upper boundary and then allows for individual selection like it is now

pan closes on click inside pan
pan and wavtype can open on multiple oscillator instances 
something weird happening with select overtone preset (generated pitches are not matching selected fundamental)
wonky stuff with the ~pitch function
add keyboard support
add sruti drones
